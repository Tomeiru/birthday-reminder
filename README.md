## Introduction

Birthday Reminder is an Android Application written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose.

It uses Room for Database, Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection and Material3 for Design Components

Note: This application was developed solely for its functionality and educational purposes.
The UI is intentionally not polished and kept to a bare minimum.

## Features

Birthday Reminder encapsulates useful features for people that want to remember the Birthdays of their friends and family:
- A resettable celebration system giving the user the possibility to know which birthdays he already celebrated or not
- Information about Today and Upcoming Birthday centralized in the Homepage
- A Birthday Catalog showing all the user's birthday and its information (date, celebration status, age) sorted by Months
- A Details screen to have more information about a birthday
- Configurable Daily Notification to tell the user if there are any birthday to wish and remind them of any non-celebrated birthday at the end of the day
- Intuitive Addition, Edition and Deletion of Birthdays
- An Easy way to batch import birthdays utilizing CSV files
- Material You!, White and Dark Mode included

## Possible Additions

I do not intend to further develop this application but possible Additions for a v2.0 could be:
- A more than bare minimum UI
- Celebration Yearly Statistics
- Process to add the Application to the Google Play Store
- CSV Export of the Birthdays Data
- Possibility to Sync Data with an online server
- Much more!
